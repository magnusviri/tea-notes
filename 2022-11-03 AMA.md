Note, I wrote this before Tea was released to the public and I still didn't understand a lot about it, so the notes might not be the most accurate. If I find somewhere else to put the information I will remove it from the notes (e.g. I removed how to run Tea and moved it to the readme).

## Notes from 2022-11-03 AMA.

Tea CLI is written in TypeScript and compiled to binary using deno (https://deno.land/).

Tea installs to ~/.tea, sandboxed. The location can be changed with env vars. Everything is compiled to be relocatable (this wasn't easy).

It sandboxes throughout. It was written as virtual environment manager first. That way you can have multiple versions of the same software installed. They are activating virtual environments by using zsh directory hooks.

Tea doesn't need to be installed. If you run it from the web (`sh <(curl tea.xyz) ...`), it will create an environment in /tmp (which is usually deleted periodically, I think on macOS it is cleaned out when you reboot). `sh <(curl tea.xyz)` (no arguments) will install the `tea` cli. If you have `tea` installed, you can replace all instances of `sh <(curl tea.xyz)` with `tea` (and vise-versa).

On macOS, Xcode Command Line Tools isn't required if the package doesn't need to be compiled to install or run it. If the package needs to be compiled, Tea comes with a compiler but it works better with Apple's and it will prompt you to use it.

Tea can "execute" markdown. If a markdown file includes a "# Getting Started" section (I'm not sure if it's "#" or "##" yet), then `sh <(curl tea.xyz) https://github.com/my/project` will execute the code in that section. I actually couldn't get this to work yet.

Private pantries are possible. Tea has their own internal QA server for testing out stuff before they deploy it.

Remuneration: Tea tokens isn't all about earning money. Remuneration can also be passed 100% to it's dependencies or donated to charity.

For developers, the different virtual environments are activated with zsh directory hooks. I don't know how that works yet.
